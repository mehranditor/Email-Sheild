# Email Shield: An Innovative Application Against Phishing Emails

In today’s digital world, phishing emails remain one of the most common cyber threats. To help users easily identify these fake and dangerous emails, I developed **Email Shield**.

## How Does Email Shield Work?

The application is built using **Dart and Flutter** for the frontend, and **Python** for the backend. It analyzes the risk level of emails and warns users with the following color-coded system:

- **Green:** Email is safe, no issues detected.
- **Yellow:** Medium risk, caution advised.
- **Orange:** High caution required.
- **Red:** Very dangerous, do not click any links.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Starts with a welcoming screen where users can enter their email and click the "Analyze" button to get instant results.

- **Dark Mode:**  
  Comfortable usage in low-light environments.

- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Available in English, Turkish, German, Chinese, Persian, Arabic, and Japanese.

- **Offline Password Strength Checker:**  
  Users can instantly check their password security level. The tool dynamically rates passwords from weak (e.g., `1`) to medium (e.g., `Mehran19`) to strong (with special characters). It also offers security tips such as enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

- **Phishing Simulator:**  
  Realistic scenarios help users recognize phishing emails. Users receive feedback for correct identifications and explanations for incorrect ones.

- **Chat Assistant:**  
  Built with Python and Flask, this chatbot answers questions like “What is phishing?” and “How to detect phishing?” providing guidance on security. It supports multiple languages for accessibility.
